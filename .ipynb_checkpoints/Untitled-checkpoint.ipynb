    "The data wrangling for this portion of the project was done on Alteryx.  The Alteryx workflow was then exported as a csv file that used Tableau to visualize the data. The data wrangling portion of this project involved cleaning the dataset by removing the \"NONE\" items, handling missing data, formating the date and time, and aggregating information for daily measurements.  I also combined the original dataset with aggregated weather data (including data on rainfall), price/cost/category of items data, and holiday data. The final cleaned, completed, and aggregated dataset is below. We had a few goals in mind:\n",
    "- Determine purchasing patterns that correlate with weather changes\n",
    "- Use transaction times to determine how the store should be staffed throughout the day\n",
    "- Determine if holidays had any significant effect on customer turn-out\n",
    "- Estimate the University of Edinburgh schedule's affect on the coffee shop\n",
    "- Map most profitable times\n",
    "- Categorize menu items and explore categorie proportions\n",
